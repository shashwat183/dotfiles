# Welcome to my dotfiles repo

This repo is a central place where I store all my dotfiles
for all the important tools I use(apart from neovim which has its own repo).
This repo contains things like my vimrc, xmonad config, piconm config, global
git config etc. You are welcome to check out the configurations and pick up 
anything interesting or useful you can find here.

## How to Install all the dotfiles

This dotfiles repo uses dotbot(https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to 
manage dotfiles. To install the dotfiles onto your home directory in the 
appropriate places just run the following command.

```bash
./.dotbot_install
```

Note - This only works on unix based systems
